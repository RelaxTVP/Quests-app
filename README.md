Quests App is a personal learning project built as a playground to explore location-based systems, game loops, and product thinking.

The app is designed as a flexible quest system where real-world location interacts with different types of challenges, goals, and rewards.

This project is not intended to be production-ready. Its main purpose is experimentation, learning, and iteration.

Why this exists

I wanted a tool that allowed me to:

Learn by building a complete feature from scratch
Experiment with location-based mechanics
Design quest logic without over-optimising too early
Keep decisions documented and revisitable
This repository reflects that process.

Core concepts

Location-aware quests
Multiple quest types
Clear quest lifecycle (available → active → completed)
Simple, explicit rules over hidden magic
Project status

🚧 Early stage — concepts defined, implementation in progress.

Notes

This is a personal project. Expect rough edges, refactors, and evolving ideas.
